# horiseon_project

My first HTML and CSS assignment.

Attempting to clean up code and improve format for each file.
Changes made include changing divs to more specific tags, readjusting paragraphs to keep code on minimal lines, and reformatting the document.

# Description

The horiseon project is a website that allows a user to view their resources by clicking on elements from the navigation bar. It is designed to be an easily accessible webpage.
